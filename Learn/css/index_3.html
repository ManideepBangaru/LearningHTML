        <h3> Article 1 </h3>
        <p> Despite the failure of Russian forces to capture 
            Kyiv and their struggle to advance along the war's 
            main frontlines in the southeastern Donbas region, 
            the Russian leader has not changed his view that 
            his troops can defeat Ukraine's, 
            Burns said. 
        </p>

        <h3> Article 2 </h3>
        <p class="paraColor1"> Putin's belief in the Russian military's 
            ability to wear down Ukrainian resistance probably 
            has not been shaken despite key battlefield defeats, 
            the US spy chief told a Financial Times 
            conference.
        </p>

        <h3> Article 3 </h3>
        <p class="paraColor2"> Burns, a former US ambassador to 
            Russia who has spent much time studying the Russian 
            leader, said his and other Western intelligence 
            agencies see no sign that Moscow is prepared to
             deploy tactical nuclear weapons in order to gain 
             a victory in Ukraine or to target Kyiv's 
             supporters.
